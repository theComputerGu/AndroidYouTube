to run the project:


Android project process:

At first, everyone worked separately on different pages, writing simple page logic and design. Tom worked on the Login and Register page, Mark worked on everything related to the homepage and Itay worked on on the videoList, videoItems and addVIdeo page.

Afterward, Mark and Itay continued the Android project while Tom worked on connecting all the different components and implementing all the necessary logic for the site to work (routing, handling all the states, user interaction, etc).

We learned from our mistake in web development, so we decided to build the pages as quickly as possible and connect them in order to work as much as possible on the logic behind it. Therefore, in about the first three days,

Mark and Itay finished the five pages that needed to be implemented and made the connection. After that, Mark and Itay worked for about a week on implementing the logic for uploading the videos + Connecting users + uploading images + writing comments, etc.

Overall, Mark handled creating the main page and the page for viewing and adding videos, while Itay handled the login and registration. During the connection and logic implementation stage, Mark and Itay worked together a lot - again, as a lesson learned from the web project.

some side notes: -we chose to do a purple(ish) dark mode, it's not very polished but it looks better than just putting a lot of grey and black
